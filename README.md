# My E-Commerce Project - Turkish Layout
I Developed an E-Commerce Project Using .NET MVC
Highlights of this website:
1-) The Slide screen on the homepage can be changed with the help of the admin panel.
2-) The featured products section on the homepage can be changed via the admin panel.
3-) Edits can be made on the Products section in the Navbar via the Admin panel and the categories you want can be added.
4-) We can add and edit as many products as we want on the Products page.
5-) We can add brand types and edit the brands we want.
6-) We can pay by credit card and view the purchased product information on SQL.


I'll be reporting here when more features are added!


Thank you!
